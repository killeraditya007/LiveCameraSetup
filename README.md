# Live Room Camera Stream with Hostinger Server

A Python-based live streaming solution that uses your Hostinger server as a relay to stream your laptop camera feed, allowing you to monitor your room from anywhere in the world.

## Features

- üé• Real-time camera streaming using OpenCV
- üåê Web-based interface accessible from anywhere on the internet
- üì± Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- üîÑ Automatic camera status monitoring
- üéõÔ∏è Easy start/stop controls
- üìä Real-time status indicators
- üöÄ Hostinger server integration for global access
- üîí Secure streaming through your own server

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam or built-in camera
- Modern web browser
- Hostinger hosting account (or any PHP-enabled web hosting)
- Internet connection on both laptop and viewing device

## Installation

### Step 1: Setup Hostinger Server

1. **Upload server files to Hostinger:**
   - Upload `server/stream_server.php` to your Hostinger's `public_html` directory
   - Upload `server/stream.html` to your Hostinger's `public_html` directory

2. **Test server setup:**
   - Visit `https://your-domain.hostinger.com/stream_server.php` to verify the API is working
   - Visit `https://your-domain.hostinger.com/stream.html` to see the web interface

### Step 2: Setup Laptop Client

1. **Clone or download this project**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd LiveStreamSetup
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your server details:**
   - Edit `config.py` and update the `HOSTINGER_CONFIG['domain']` with your actual Hostinger domain
   - Optionally adjust camera and network settings

## Usage

### Starting the Stream

1. **Run the Python client on your laptop**
   ```bash
   python backend/app.py
   ```

2. **The client will automatically:**
   - Connect to your Hostinger server
   - Start your laptop camera
   - Begin streaming video to the server

3. **Access the live feed from anywhere:**
   - Open your browser and go to: `https://your-domain.hostinger.com/stream.html`
   - The web interface will automatically connect and display your live camera feed

### Using the Web Interface

1. **Automatic Connection**: The web app automatically connects to your stream
2. **View Live Feed**: Your laptop camera feed appears in real-time
3. **Status Monitoring**: See server and stream status at the bottom
4. **Refresh**: Use "Refresh Stream" if the video stops working

### Local Monitoring (Optional)

You can also monitor the stream locally by visiting:
```
http://localhost:5000
```
This shows the client status and allows manual camera control.

## How It Works

### Architecture
```
Laptop Camera ‚Üí Python Client ‚Üí Hostinger Server ‚Üí Web Browser (Anywhere)
```

1. **Laptop**: Python client captures video from your camera
2. **Hostinger Server**: Receives video frames and stores them temporarily
3. **Web Browser**: Fetches latest frames from server and displays them
4. **Global Access**: Anyone with the URL can view your stream from anywhere

### Network Flow
- Your laptop sends video frames to your Hostinger server via HTTPS
- The server stores the latest frame and serves it to web browsers
- Multiple people can view the stream simultaneously
- No port forwarding or complex network setup required

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes:**

- This setup is for personal use and testing
- The camera feed is transmitted over HTTPS to your server
- Consider adding authentication for production use
- Be aware of privacy implications when streaming
- Your Hostinger server acts as a relay - ensure it's secure
- Consider adding password protection to the web interface

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
- **Camera not detected**: Make sure no other applications are using the camera
- **Permission denied**: Grant camera permissions to your terminal/IDE
- **Poor quality**: Adjust camera settings in `config.py`

### Server Connection Issues
- **Cannot connect to Hostinger**: Check your domain in `config.py`
- **Server not responding**: Verify `stream_server.php` is uploaded correctly
- **API errors**: Check Hostinger error logs

### Streaming Issues
- **No video feed**: Ensure laptop client is running and connected
- **Delayed video**: Normal for internet streaming, adjust quality in config
- **Stream stops**: Check internet connection on laptop

### Common Solutions
1. **Restart the laptop client** if streaming stops
2. **Check camera permissions** in your system settings
3. **Verify Hostinger server files** are uploaded correctly
4. **Test server API** by visiting the PHP file directly
5. **Check internet connection** on both laptop and viewing device

## Customization

### Video Quality
Edit `backend/app.py` to adjust:
- Frame size: `cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH` and `cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT`
- Frame rate: `cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS`
- JPEG quality: `cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY`

### Styling
Modify `frontend/index.html` to customize:
- Colors and themes
- Layout and responsive design
- Additional features and controls

### Hostinger Files
Upload these files to your Hostinger `public_html` directory:
- `server/stream_server.php` ‚Üí `public_html/stream_server.php`
- `server/stream.html` ‚Üí `public_html/stream.html`

## Dependencies

### Python Dependencies (Laptop)
- **opencv-python**: Camera capture and video processing
- **flask**: Local web server for monitoring
- **flask-cors**: Cross-origin resource sharing
- **pillow**: Image processing
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **requests**: HTTP requests to Hostinger server

### Server Requirements (Hostinger)
- **PHP 7.0+**: For the server script
- **File write permissions**: To store temporary stream data
- **HTTPS support**: For secure streaming

## Configuration Options

### Camera Settings (`config.py`)
```python
CAMERA_CONFIG = {
    'device_id': 0,      # Camera device (0 = default)
    'width': 640,        # Video width
    'height': 480,       # Video height
    'fps': 30,           # Frames per second
    'quality': 85        # JPEG quality (1-100)
}
```

### Network Settings (`config.py`)
```python
NETWORK_CONFIG = {
    'local_port': 5000,  # Local monitoring port
    'timeout': 5,        # Request timeout
    'max_retries': 3     # Retry attempts
}
```

## Advanced Setup

### Multiple Cameras
To stream from multiple laptops:
1. Use different `stream_id` values in each laptop's `config.py`
2. Modify the web interface to select which stream to view

### Custom Domain
If you have a custom domain on Hostinger:
1. Update `HOSTINGER_CONFIG['domain']` in `config.py`
2. Ensure SSL certificate is active

### Authentication
For added security, consider:
1. Adding password protection to the web interface
2. Implementing API key authentication
3. Using HTTPS for all communications
